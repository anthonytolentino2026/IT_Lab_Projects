# High Availability Secured Enterprise Campus Network

Packet Tracer project demonstrating a highly available enterprise campus architecture utilizing dual ISP connectivity, redundant firewalls, HSRP gateway failover, EtherChannel uplinks, wireless infrastructure, centralized network services, and Layer 2 redundancy mechanisms.

---

## Overview

This project focuses on designing and implementing a highly available and secure enterprise campus network using Cisco enterprise technologies. The architecture was built to eliminate single points of failure while maintaining reliable connectivity for wired and wireless users.

High availability was achieved through dual ISP connectivity, redundant Cisco ASA firewalls, HSRP gateway redundancy, EtherChannel link aggregation, and Rapid-PVST+ convergence mechanisms. Wireless services were centralized through a Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) managing Lightweight Access Points (LWAPs), while DHCP, DNS, and AAA services were deployed to provide essential enterprise network services.

The resulting design closely resembles modern campus infrastructures that require resiliency, scalability, and centralized management.

## Topology

</div>

The topology follows a hierarchical campus design consisting of internet edge devices, redundant firewall infrastructure, multilayer core switches, access switches, wireless infrastructure, and centralized server services.

HSRP provides default gateway redundancy for all VLANs, while EtherChannel and Rapid-PVST+ ensure continuous Layer 2 connectivity during link or device failures. Wireless users authenticate through centralized AAA services and receive network access through the Wireless LAN Controller architecture.
